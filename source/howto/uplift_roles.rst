Your hats
=========

When using Uplift, you will be having 2 main roles:

* a *packager* role, where you take external or internal unity packages and place them into Uplift repositories. These packages become then usable through Uplift.

* a *user* role, where you use Uplift to install those packages into your project.

.. Note:: As time go, your main role will be *user*. A package needs to be packaged only once and the task of packaging the packages will become more and more automated thanks to tooling.
