.. _howto-package-versioning:

Define your package version
===========================

Uplift recommends that you follow the syntax defined by `Semantic Versioning 2.0
<http://semver.org/>`_.

We strongly encourage you to read the information on this website as it proposes a good standard for versioning in software engineering.

To summarize the idea is to have your version follow this pattern ``X.Y.Z``, with:

- ``X`` being the **MAJOR** version of your package, when you make incompatible API changes.
- ``Y`` being the **MINOR** version of your package, when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner.
- ``X`` being the **PATCH** version of your package, when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.
