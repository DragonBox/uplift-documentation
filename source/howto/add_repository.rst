.. _faq_add_repository:

Add a Repository To Your Project
======================================

1. Open ``Upfile.xml``

   Open it in your favourite editor.
   Can't find it? See :ref:`faq-upfile`

2. Add repository inside ``<Repositories></Repositories>`` tags.

   There are multiple Repositories Types available, refer to `../repository/supported_repositories`
   which parameters are important for each and what the prerequisites are.

   Example ``Upfile.xml`` with a single *FileRepository* should look something like this:

   .. code-block:: xml

      <Repositories>
        <FileRepository Path="Path/To/MyRepository" />
      </Repositories>

3. In Unity select Uplift â€£ Refresh Upfile

No further actions are required. Enjoy your newly connected repository.
