Version Requirements
====================

When specifying a dependency, you can specify its version thanks to the following syntax

* fixed requirement ("1.2.3!"). Only that version.
* minimal requirement ("1.2+"). 1.2 and onwards. Accepts 1.3, 2.0, etc
* lose requirement ("1.2"). FIXME similar to minimal?
* bounded requirement ("1.2.*"). 1.2 <= v < 1.3.
